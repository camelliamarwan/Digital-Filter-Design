## Introduction
This desktop application allows users to design custom digital filters by placing zeros and poles on the z-plane. Users can visualize the filter's frequency response and apply the designed filter to real-time signals. Additionally, the application provides tools to correct for phase distortion using All-Pass filters.

## Features
**Interactive Z-Plane Plot:**
- Users can place zeros and poles on the z-plane.
- Modify the positions of zeros/poles by dragging them.

- Delete zeros or poles by clicking on them.
- Clear all zeros, all poles, or all elements.

- Option to add conjugates for complex elements.
- Drag the pair of conjugates simultaneously
- Delete tha paie of conjugates together

**Real-Time Filtering:**
- Users can generate and input an arbitrary real-time signal by moving the mouse on a small padding area.
- The speed of mouse movement dictates the frequency content of the generated signal, with faster motion resulting in higher frequencies and slower motion resulting in lower frequencies.
